Always look in the Dir OpenCV folder when it comes to computer graphics or something like that. All the documentation for OpenCV is written there to make it easier for you to use it. Divide your search into blocks and tasks that we are pursuing and solve them one by one. It's like the Holy Grail for us because it's very good documentation. Everything I said.
